# Python-Projects
So this is my first mini project I created to test out the things i have learned so far.
I made a quiz that used if statements,
Formatted the questions using the f{} format,
and implemented the use of lists.
There are some code I would like to improve on, especially the part with formating because I feel like it am repeating the print() function unneccesarily.
